                <h2>Print Instructions</h2>
                <p>Printing these on to cards is a little bit of a process.  We have gone through a lot of effort to make it so that you CAN print these directly to index cards to save you a lot of effort of cutting multiple cards on a single larger paper, but to print on cards you have to do a bit of the work.</p>
                
                <p>You have a few options for printing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Print on a larger sheet of paper and cut the cards out yourself</li>
                    <li>Print on index cards where one card will print on each with no additional cutting.</li>
                    <li>Save the print view of the index card version so that you can send it to a photo printer to print the cards</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Index card/photo printing</h3>
                <p>I am on a Mac and have only gotten this to work on <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> (not Safari or Firefox). Hopefully it will similarly work on Chrome on Windows.</p>
                
                <p>When printing do the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Layout</strong>: Choose portrait or landscape depending on the layout you have chosen</li>
                    <li>Open "More settings"</li>
                    <li><strong>Paper size</strong>: choose the size that you will be printing on, for either index cards or photos</li>
                    <li><strong>Margins</strong>: choose "None"</li>
                    <li>If you are printing via your own printer, click <strong>Print</strong>.  If you are sending to a photo service choose "Open PDF in Preview" on a Mac and hopefully you can find something similar on Windows.</li>
                    <li>If you are printing to a photo service, they usually do not take PDFs as source for the photos.  I used <a href="http://pdf2jpg.net/">PDFtoJPG.net</a> to convert the PDF to jpg images that you can upload to your photo service of choice.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The above is complicated and yet at the same time vague. Sorry about that. I wish it could be easier, but printing in this way just isn't an easy thing.  Good luck :)</p>

                <p>In the textarea above, enter the items you would like to be made into cards. This only works with certain numbers of items:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3 items</strong> - 2 items per card</li>
                    <li><strong>7 items</strong> - 3 items per card</li>
                    <li><strong>13 items</strong> - 4 items per card</li>
                    <li><strong>31 items</strong> - 6 items per card</li>
                    <li><strong>57 items</strong> - 8 items per card</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you enter more or less than those numbers we will truncate your list down to the next lower number, except for below 2 where we won't be able to use it at all. I don't really understand the math/logic, so am not sure why there aren't 5 and 7 per card options.  I used what was made available in <a href="http://radiganengineering.com/2013/01/spot-it-howd-they-do-that/">this article</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Separate each item by a return.  You can use text, or if you provide URLs ending in .jpg, .gif or .png, we will load those images. If your images are different aspect ratios (square, landscape, portrait) your cards will be difference sizes as each card is made up of a different mixture of sizes.  For best results, have all images be the same general aspect ratio.</p>
                
                <p>You can optionally provide a label for images by adding a , to the end of the image URL and then putting your label.  <code>http://path/to/image.jpg,label here</code></p>

            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>Our family purchased the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039S7NO6">Spot it</a> game and I was facinated by how there could only be one match no matter what two cards you looked at.  I went to the internet to find out how it worked.  I found <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/36798/what-is-the-math-behind-the-game-spot-it">several</a> <a href="http://bowmandickson.com/2012/07/15/math-circle-problem-analysis-of-the-game-spot-it/">discussions</a> about it that were all above my mental capacities for math.  Then I bumped into <a href="http://radiganengineering.com/2013/01/spot-it-howd-they-do-that/">this article</a> that had examples of what the cards would be for different item numbers.  Well if I didn't have to figure things out, I could do something with that.</p>
            
            <p>I thought it would be really cool to make my own Spot It game with my own pictures.  So I started digging into making a version that could accept input and generate the game for me.  After way too many hours of playing with the code and neglecting my family, this site was created.  This allows you to provide your own images or words and cards will be "randomly" generated.  I used the structure from RadiganEngineering but randomize the card order and randomize the order of the items within each card.</p>
            
            <p>Naturally I had to keep adding functionality, demo content, save the data locally, pass content in via the URL, load demos via URL, etc. The basic card generation and game I had done in a day, all the other stuff took several weekends.</p>
            
            <p>I hope this is of benefit to others. I found <a href="https://creativenrg.wordpress.com/2015/06/22/mathematical-magic-goldman-family-spot-it/">this blog post</a> about creating a Spot It game with family pictures. It looks like it took a lot of work to make that happen. Hopefully this site allows similar creations in a fraction of the time.</p>
            
            <p>I don't pretend to think this is perfect. It was hacked together pretty quickly despite it take so long. I debated between using newer technologies (SASS, ES6, etc) to help myself improve, but for now I decided to leave it as basic JavaScript so that it is easier for others to understand. Some day I may make it fancier.  So for all my techy friends, don't mock my lack of using the latest and greatest, it was for the greater good :)  Some day it will bother me enough to update everything, but for now it is what it is.</p>
